/*
1- Create a class, Book, with a title and an author.
2- Add a method, readPage(), that increases the value of a private variable, currentPage, by 1.
3- Create a subclass of Book; name it eBook.
4- eBook also takes in a format, which defaults to "text".
5- In eBooks, counting words makes more sense than pages.
   Override the readPage() method to increase the word count by 250,
   the average number of words per page from typewriter days.
